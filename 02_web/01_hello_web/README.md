# A Ruby Web Service using Sinatra for simple GET Requests

* Install dependencies using "ruby -S bundle install"
* Run the script using "ruby -S bundle exec ruby application.rb"

You should study the code for application.rb and get to know it well.


Test out the service by visiting the following URLs:

* http://localhost:4567/time.xml
* http://localhost:4567/time.json
* http://localhost:4567/time.yaml
* http://localhost:4567/time.txt
* http://localhost:4567/echo/hi+there
* http://localhost:4567/echo?message=this%20is%20cool

Next Steps:

* Modify application.rb to implement the 'reverse' endpoints
* Modify application.rb to implement the 'pig latin' endpoints
* Modify application.rb to implement the 'snowball' endpoints

Advanced:

* Rework all of the endpoints to return content types based on
  the given parameter (for example, "/reverse.xml" and "/snowball.json")
