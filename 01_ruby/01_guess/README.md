# The Guessing Game

* Run the script using "ruby guess.rb 10" (or whatever limit you like)
* Run the auto-player using "ruby play.rb 10"

You should study the code for guess.rb and play.rb and get to know it well.

Next Steps:

* Implement more efficient guessing in play.rb
* Modify guess.rb so that it occasionally lies to the client about lower/higher
* Modify play.rb so that it detects the lying server and 'calls it out'
